# Changes Summary - BabelPod Bug Fixes and Testing

## Overview
This PR addresses all issues raised in the original issue: adds tests, fixes UI bugs, improves reliability, and includes a comprehensive code review.

## Latest Update: Merged Beneficial Changes from DerDaku/master (Oct 2025)

### Changes Merged
This update merges carefully selected improvements from the [DerDaku/master PR #31](https://github.com/afaden/babelpod/pull/31) while avoiding duplication and breaking changes.

### What Was Added

#### 1. Enhanced mDNS Library (dnssd2)
- **Upgraded from mdns-js to dnssd2** for better service discovery
- **New event handlers**: `serviceUp`, `serviceChanged`, `serviceDown`
- **Dynamic IP handling**: AirPlay devices that change IP addresses are now properly tracked
- **Better service updates**: Stereo paired HomePods are reliably detected even after network changes

#### 2. Bluetooth Input Support ✨NEW
- **Bluetooth audio input**: Stream audio from paired Bluetooth devices (phones, tablets, laptops)
- **Auto-connection**: Automatically connects to unpaired Bluetooth devices when selected
- **Status tracking**: Shows connection status for each Bluetooth device
- **Format**: Uses bluealsa for ALSA-compatible Bluetooth audio streaming

**Setup:**
```bash
# Pair your Bluetooth device first
bluetoothctl
> pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
> trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

#### 3. Optional PCM Device Scanning
- **Default behavior**: PCM scanning is now enabled by default for backward compatibility
- **Environment variable control**: Set `DISABLE_PCM=1` to disable PCM device scanning
- **Use case**: Ideal for systems that only use Bluetooth or don't have ALSA hardware

**Default:** Scans /proc/asound/pcm every 10 seconds  
**With DISABLE_PCM=1:** Skips PCM scanning for better performance

#### 4. Improved AirPlay Streaming Stability
- **Pipe option**: Added `{end: false}` to airtunes pipe for better stability
- **Prevents premature stream closing**: Stream stays open during input changes
- **Better multi-device support**: More reliable when streaming to multiple AirPlay devices

#### 5. Updated Dependencies
- **airtunes2**: Pinned to v2.4.9 for stability and Node 20 compatibility
- **dnssd2**: v1.0.0 for better mDNS handling
- **bluetoothctl**: Added support via DerDaku's node-bluetoothctl fork

### What Was NOT Merged

- **Stereo HomePod support**: Already implemented in current codebase (no duplication)
- **UI dropdown height increase**: Current code uses checkboxes, not dropdowns (not applicable)

### Tests Added
New test suites covering the merged functionality:
- PCM environment variable behavior (enabled by default, can be disabled)
- Bluetooth device ID formatting and connection tracking
- mDNS service event handling (serviceUp, serviceChanged, serviceDown)
- AirPlay device regex patterns
- Stereo pairing detection
- Pipe stability options

**Test Results:** All 16 tests passing ✅

### Breaking Changes
**None** - All changes are backward compatible:
- PCM works by default (set `DISABLE_PCM=1` to disable if not needed)
- Existing AirPlay devices continue to work
- No changes to the UI or user-facing behavior
- Bluetooth is optional (gracefully handles missing bluetoothctl module)

### Migration Guide
PCM devices work by default with no configuration needed. 

If you don't use PCM devices and want better performance:
```bash
# Disable PCM device scanning for systems without ALSA
DISABLE_PCM=1 node index.js
```

For new Bluetooth support:
```bash
# Install bluetoothctl if not already installed
sudo apt-get install bluez

# Pair your devices
bluetoothctl
```

## Previous Update: Automatic Input Recovery (Dec 2024)

### Problem
Service would stop broadcasting audio after a few hours of idle time. The arecord process capturing USB audio would crash or lose connection, but the service wouldn't attempt to recover, requiring a manual restart.

### Solution
Implemented automatic input device recovery with retry logic:

```javascript
// Automatic restart on unexpected exit
- Detects when arecord exits unexpectedly (non-zero exit code or signal)
- Distinguishes between manual input switches and crashes
- Attempts up to 3 automatic reconnection attempts with 2-second delays
- Provides clear user feedback during reconnection attempts
- Resets retry counter on successful manual input selection
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatic reconnection when USB audio device disconnects
- Prevents restart loops during manual input switching
- User-visible status messages: "Input device disconnected - attempting to reconnect..."
- Success notification: "Input device reconnected: [device]"
- Failure notification after max attempts: "Input device failed after 3 reconnection attempts. Please reselect the input."

This fixes the issue where the service would silently stop working after USB connection loss, requiring a full Raspberry Pi restart.

## Key Changes

### 1. UI Bug Fixes

#### Volume Slider Issues (Fixed)
- **Background not updating**: Added `updateSliderProgress()` call when server sends volume updates
- **Dragging unreliable**: Added 100ms debouncing to prevent flooding the server with updates
- **Smooth operation**: Slider now updates immediately in UI, but sends updates to server in batched manner

#### Output Selection Issues (Fixed)
- **Hit or miss selection**: Added 150ms debouncing to checkbox changes
- **Race conditions**: Prevented rapid state changes from causing conflicts
- **Better state management**: Checkboxes now reliably reflect server state

### 2. Error Handling & Reliability

#### Comprehensive Error Handlers Added
```javascript
// Process errors (arecord, aplay)
- spawn errors
- stderr monitoring
- exit code checking
- automatic cleanup

// Stream errors
- pipe errors
- duplicator errors
- input stream errors

// Network errors
- AirTunes connection failures
- mDNS browser errors
- Socket.io connection issues

// Global handlers
- uncaughtException
- unhandledRejection
- SIGINT/SIGTERM (graceful shutdown)
```

#### User-Visible Error Reporting
- Status messages in green (auto-dismiss after 5s)
- Error messages in red (auto-dismiss after 10s)
- Connection status indicators
- Server error forwarding to UI

### 3. Code Quality Improvements

#### Removed Redundant Code
- Duplicate CSS rule for webkit-slider-runnable-track
- Redundant hover style that broke progress bar

#### Documentation Added
- TODO comment for Bluetooth input (placeholder for future feature)
- Comprehensive TESTING.md manual testing guide
- Updated README with error handling section
- Inline code comments for complex logic

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

#### Test Setup
- Jest configured and working
- Node environment for unit tests
- Placeholder test structure for future expansion

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive manual testing checklist
- Browser compatibility requirements
- Expected behavior documentation
- Error scenario testing guide

## Technical Details

### Debouncing Implementation
```javascript
// Volume slider - 100ms debounce
let volumeChangeTimeout = null;
volumeRange.addEventListener("input", (ev) => {
  updateSliderProgress(); // Immediate UI update
  if (volumeChangeTimeout) clearTimeout(volumeChangeTimeout);
  volumeChangeTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    socket.emit("change_output_volume", ev.target.value);
  }, 100);
});

// Output checkboxes - 150ms debounce
if (window.outputChangeTimeout) clearTimeout(window.outputChangeTimeout);
window.outputChangeTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
  socket.emit("switch_output", sel);
}, 150);
```

### Error Recovery Pattern
```javascript
try {
  // Risky operation
  process.spawn(...)
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Error:", e);
  io.emit('server_error', { message: 'User-friendly error' });
  // Continue operating
}
```
