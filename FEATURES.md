# üéµ BabelPod Features & Divergence from Upstream

This document lists all features and major changes in **benlachman/babelpod** that diverge from the original [afaden/babelpod](https://github.com/afaden/babelpod) repository since forking/merging.

---

## üéØ Overview

This fork includes significant enhancements focused on **reliability**, **error handling**, **Bluetooth support**, and **user experience improvements**. Many improvements were cherry-picked and adapted from [DerDaku/babelpod](https://github.com/DerDaku/babelpod/tree/master).

## ‚ú® Major Features Added

### 1. üéß Bluetooth Input Support (Cherry-picked from DerDaku)

**What it does:**
- Stream audio from paired Bluetooth devices (phones, tablets, laptops, speakers)
- Automatically connects to Bluetooth devices when selected as input
- Shows connection status for each Bluetooth device
- Uses bluealsa for ALSA-compatible Bluetooth audio streaming

**Why it matters:**
- Enables wireless audio streaming from any Bluetooth source
- No need for physical line-in connections
- Perfect for streaming music from phones or tablets

**Changes made:**
- Added `bluetoothctl` dependency from DerDaku's fork
- Implemented Bluetooth device discovery and listing
- Added auto-connection logic when Bluetooth input is selected
- Device appears as "Bluetooth: [device name]" in input dropdown

**Requirements:**
- `bluez` package installed
- Devices must be paired using `bluetoothctl` first

---

### 2. üîÑ Automatic Input Recovery

**What it does:**
- Automatically restarts audio capture when input device disconnects
- Attempts up to 3 reconnection attempts with 2-second delays
- Provides clear user feedback during reconnection
- Prevents silent failures that required manual restart

**Why it matters:**
- **Solves a critical reliability issue**: Service would stop broadcasting audio after a few hours when USB audio devices disconnected
- No more manual Raspberry Pi restarts needed
- Perfect for permanent/always-on installations

**Changes made:**
```javascript
// Detects unexpected exits and attempts automatic recovery
- Distinguishes between manual input switches and crashes
- Retry logic with configurable attempts and delays
- User notifications: "Input device disconnected - attempting to reconnect..."
- Success/failure messages in UI
```

**Technical details:**
- Monitors arecord process exit codes
- Resets retry counter on successful manual input selection
- Prevents restart loops during intentional input changes

---

### 3. üåê Enhanced mDNS Service Discovery (Cherry-picked from DerDaku)

**What it does:**
- Upgraded from `mdns-js` to `dnssd2` library for better service discovery
- Handles dynamic IP address changes for AirPlay devices
- Improved event handling: `serviceUp`, `serviceChanged`, `serviceDown`
- Better detection of stereo paired HomePods even after network changes

**Why it matters:**
- More reliable AirPlay device discovery
- Handles network topology changes gracefully
- Better support for complex setups like stereo paired HomePods

**Changes made:**
- Replaced mdns-js dependency with dnssd2 v1.0.0
- Implemented new event handlers for service lifecycle
- Added IP address change tracking
- Improved service update logic

---

### 4. ‚öôÔ∏è Optional PCM Device Scanning (Cherry-picked from DerDaku)

**What it does:**
- PCM scanning enabled by default for backward compatibility
- Can be disabled via `DISABLE_PCM=1` environment variable
- Improves performance on systems that only use Bluetooth or don't have ALSA hardware

**Why it matters:**
- Better performance on systems without PCM devices
- More flexible deployment options
- Reduced CPU usage when PCM scanning is unnecessary

**Changes made:**
- Added environment variable check: `process.env.DISABLE_PCM`
- Default behavior: Scans `/proc/asound/pcm` every 10 seconds
- With `DISABLE_PCM=1`: Skips PCM scanning entirely
- Added `BABEL_PORT` environment variable for custom port configuration

**Usage:**
```bash
# Disable PCM scanning for better performance
DISABLE_PCM=1 node index.js

# Custom port
BABEL_PORT=8080 node index.js
```

- Clean shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM

**Why it matters:**
- **Service won't crash** when devices fail
- Users see what's happening without checking server logs
- Better debugging and troubleshooting experience

**Changes made:**
```javascript

## üéØ Important Design Choices

### 1. **PCM Scanning Default Behavior**
- **Decision**: Enable by default, allow disabling via environment variable
- **Reason**: Backward compatibility - existing users expect PCM devices to work without configuration
- **Trade-off**: Slightly higher CPU usage on systems that don't need it, but can be disabled

### 2. **Debouncing Timeouts**
- **Decision**: 100ms for volume slider, 150ms for output checkboxes
- **Reason**: Balance between responsiveness and server load
- **Testing**: Values chosen after testing with multiple rapid UI interactions

### 3. **Automatic Retry Logic**
- **Decision**: 3 attempts with 2-second delays
- **Reason**: Enough attempts to handle temporary disconnects, not too many to cause long delays
- **User control**: Users can manually reselect input immediately if needed

### 4. **Error Message Auto-Dismiss**
- **Decision**: 5s for status (green), 10s for errors (red)
- **Reason**: Status messages are informational, errors need more time to read
- **User experience**: Keeps UI clean while ensuring important messages are seen

### 5. **Dependency Pinning**
- **Decision**: Pin airtunes2 to specific version, use semver for others
- **Reason**: airtunes2 stability is critical; other deps can auto-update minor versions
- **Maintenance**: Easier security updates while maintaining audio stability

---

## üìã Requirement Updates

### New System Requirements:
1. **Optional: Bluetooth support**
   - `bluez` package for Bluetooth pairing
   - `bluetoothctl` for device management

2. **Node.js compatibility**

   - Build environment for native modules (build-essential)

3. **Environment variables**
